# Restaurant-Ordering-System

This is a java project implementing the basic OOP methods for a restaurant ordering system during my first year. 
It also included a GUI where we can visualize the process on eclipse.

The idea was to implement the basics of OOP using java for a system where u can order several options from the menu and the price be calculated automatically.
There was an additional feature for the app where we give the customer the ability to pay in different currencies simply by converting the price on the same panel.
